Let `a` and `b` be any objects, then `a = b` is a proposition (also written as `Eq a b`). `Eq` admits several properties

- `Eq.refl`: Let `a` be any object, then `Eq.refl a: a = a` is a proof

- `Eq.symm`: Let `hab: a = b` be a proof, then `Eq.symm hab: b = a` is also a proof

- `Eq.trans`: Let `hab: a = b`, `hbc: b = c` be proofs, then `Eq.trans hab hbc: a = c` is also a proof


In proving equality, lean provides several substitution rules

- `Eq.subst`: Let `x: $\alpha$` and `y: $\alpha$`. Let `h: a = b` be a proof and `p: $\alpha \to$ Prop`, then if `hx: p x` is a proof, then `Eq:subst: p y` is also a proof

- `congrArg`: Let `x: $\alpha$` and `y: $\alpha$`. Let `h: a = b` be a proof and `f: $\alpha \to \beta$`, then `congrArg f h: f x = f y` is a proof

- `congrFun`: Let `f: $\alpha \to \beta$` and `g: $\alpha \to \beta$`. Let `h: f = g` and `x: $\alpha$`, then `congrFun h x: f x = g x` is a proof

- `congr`: Let `x: $\alpha$` and `y: $\alpha$`. Let `f: $\alpha \to \beta$` and `g: $\alpha \to \beta$`. Let `h\_1: x = y` and `h\_2: f = g`, then `congr h\_2 h\_1: f x = g y` is a proof
